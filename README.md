# 👋 Hi, I'm Steward Wesley

I’m a career-transitioning **Data Analyst** passionate about extracting actionable insights from data and solving real-world business problems. With a solid foundation in **B2C retail sales and visual merchandising**, I bring a unique business perspective to data analytics.

Over the past year, I’ve self-taught data analysis through hands-on projects, completing a course in **Python Data Analysis** on Udemy, and publishing work on **GitHub** and **Power BI dashboards**. My experience spans data cleaning, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and storytelling through tools like **Excel**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**.

🔎 Currently seeking remote **Data Analyst** roles where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and continue growing in a collaborative environment.
